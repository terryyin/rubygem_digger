    "\n",
    "Matured open source community, for example the Ruby community, has been growing for many years. There are once popular software components abandoned by the authors for a long time, leaving people depending on them unexpected problems. There are also open source software projects that has been continuously maintained. All the efforts in making software eventually goes to it's source code. With a typical open source package management system, we can find the source code of all versions and all packages. In my research, I tried to find a way to apply machine learning to the source code change history. One goal of the research is to use it to predict the risk of abandonware; another goal is to learn the reason why some software is abandoned and some are well-maintained. RubyGems.org is the de-facto Ruby package repository. Terobytes of Ruby source code will be explored and analyzed. The result of this research is constrained by its scope. The reasons that the authors gave up their open source projects are not always found in the source code."

    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "As Jack W. Reeves (1992) pointed out, \"the design\" of software is the source code itself. All the efforts in making software eventually embody its value via software. Software packages of script programming language like Ruby are destributed in the form of source code. We can find all the history version of open source software projects from a public package management system. This research tries to find a way of applying machine learning to the source code change history in the Ruby package management system, to learn to predict software maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "The scope of the research is within the RubyGems.org package management system. There's terabytes of source code on it. Only the software packages fit in our criteria of \"abandoned\" software and \"well-maintained\" software will be further analyzed. Both the static state of the software project and the change history are analyzed. However the change history is limited to the versions managed by RubyGems. More refined change history might be found from the software configuration management system (SCM). However, the SCM is not within the scope of this research.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple statistics and machine learning method will be applied to the processed data generated from the source code. I also built a prototype software that does all these works. The purpose of the prototype is to proove the concept. It's not intended to become a comercially useable tool. It's not intended to be generalized to other type of source code prediction.\n",

    "Ruby is a popular programming language. It's widely used as a programming language in Web service and automation. Ruby also has a large open source community. The RubyGems.org is where most of the open source Ruby project release their software packages. At the beginning of the year 2017, there are about 13908 gems, with 1126308 different versions. A lot of software developers are working on their gems all the time. In 2016, 44 gems were released per day,\n",
    "332 gem versions were released per day (Ćilimković, 2017).\n",
    "\n",
    "With the rich collection of Ruby gems, people can do their job much faster. But depending on an open source library also introduce future risks. Some software packages do focused and simple things. They tend to stabilize after a period and do not need much active maintenance. But most non-trivial software libraries do need ongoing maintenance to address new problems, adjust to new environment and adding new features. It can be painful when depending on a third party library and then found that the open source developers of the library stopped maintaining it.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 1132 Ruby gems stop having any new versions before 2015, which had been actively maintained for more than ten months before they stopped. Please find the definition for \"actively maintained for more than ten months\" in Process - Labeling the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also many Ruby gems that have been maintained actively for a long time with many releases. From software maintainability's perspective, they are at least \"maintainable\" code some releases back from the recent.\n",
    "\n",
    "There could be different reasons why certain Ruby project stopped, and why some are still continuing. RubyGems.org keeps all the gems versions and most of the gems developers tend to release often. Perhaps we can find a behavioral trace in the releases. Ruby libraries are distributed in the form of source code. If there's a pattern or we can get a model, then we can use it to evaluate Ruby source code or learn how to increase software maintainability.\n",

    "### On maintainability\n",
    "\n",
    "Software maintainability decides the cost of owning a codebase. IEEE defines it as “the ease with which a software system or component can be modified to correct faults, improve the performance or other attributes, or adapt to a changed environment” (IEEE, 1990). I will try to define maintainable software from the result's perspective. Say, at a certain point of time *T*, a system or component is maintained. If this software system or component has been actively maintained to continuously correct faults, improve the performance or other attributes, or adapt to a changed environment, for a period *P*. Then I can say the state of the software at the time *T* has at least some maintainability. And I made an assumption that if a software system or component stopped maintenance at *T* tends to have less maintainability. Especially, it is so when there's evidence based on the software's development history before *T* that continuous maintenance is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the above assumption, I can label a version of software as 'maintainable' or 'not maintainable' by analyzing it release history."

    "### On open source \"Abandonware\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Khong (2007) defined abandonware as the copyrighted work that's still owned by the owner, but because the owner ignored the work it is no longer commercially available to the public. One problem caused by abandonware, as pointed out by Khong (2007) is that some software may need continual support from the vendors or producers. Many open source software also fit in the definition of abandonware, that is the source code is still available to the public, but the owner of the project ignores it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Khong (2007) mentioned, \"A related problem of abandonment of computer software is the unavailability\n",
    "of source codes to correct or modify a computer program.\" It is no longer the case for open source abandonware. However having the source of origin doesn't solve the problem completely. It still takes the domain knowledge, the knowledge of the software structure, the interest and the effort to maintain the software, which the user of open source software might not have. And the original access point (the library server, the version control system) might still be owned by the original author. Then it's hard to continue the project and share the maintained work with the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my research of the Ruby open source abandonware, I found some have over a hundred open issues on Github. Some people depending on the software are crying for support. Some of the abandonware have tens of pull requests, but the owners just ignore them. One example is the CanCan Ruby gem created by Ryan Bates and first released in 2009 and soon becomes very popular (6000+ stars on Github as of today). It's an enhancement to the Ruby on Rails framework to support authorization. As it's intended to be part of the framework, projects depending on CanCan tend to have a tight coupling with it. When in 2013 the project suddenly stopped all development activity on Github, it became a big problem. We can see now the CanCan project has more than eight hundred forks. Some people chose to take the source code and maintain it by themselves. Eventually, some people formed the \"CanCanCan Community\" and continue the \"CanCan\" project under the name of \"CanCanCan\" (https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan).\n",
    "\n",
    "Abandonware doesn't always indicate unmaintainable software. For example, \"why the lucky stiff\" (2017) is the nickname of a Ruby programmer who was considered one of the best Ruby programmers in the world (Spolsky 2005). He mythically disappeared since 2009. It's probably not right to call his legacy \"unmaintainable.\""

    "## Literature Review\n",
    "\n",
    "Riaz, Mendes,& Tempero (2009) had a systematic review of software maintainability prediction and metrics. They found that the commonly used maintainability prediction models were based on algorithmic techniques. And the method could be particular with some maintenance type. Size, complexity and coupling, all these are collected at source code level only. There's a lack of accuracy measures and cross-validation. They also found that expert judgment plays an important role when designing these metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Riaz et al. (2009) suggested the creation of more robust and reliable software maintainability prediction models. It is what I'm trying to achieve by this research. In my prediction model, although the underlying data is also mostly from source code, I put them in time scale and combined several tools' result to avoid prejudice. I intended to use machine learning mechanism to prevent expert opinion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beller, Bholanath, McIntosh, & Zaidman (2016) made a research on the usage of Automated Static Analysis Tools (ASATs). In their study, they found that 60% of the most popular open source projects use ASATs, although not embed them as part of their workflow. It might bias my data a bit, as some of the popular projects used ASAT, therefore the analyzing result has been optimized towards certain tool already. But I'm confident that it won't have a big impact. Because in my research, I only take code older than 2015. All the three tools I used has tons of new features since 2015.\n",
    "\n",
    "My open source Static Analyzer \"lizard\" has been used in many large projects, including the ATLAS project at CERN (Kluth, et al. 2016). The ATLAS Experiment (Anelli et al. 2008) use lizard to get the cyclomatic complexity metrics in their C++ and Python code. Lizard also supports many other programming languages including Ruby.\n",
    "\n",
    "I use the countings of automatically detected \"code smells\" as part of the data I extract from source code. Code smells, as Fowler & Beck (1999) defined as symptoms of poor design and implementation choices. They are the anti-patterns. As a result, code smells will affect the maintainability of software. Tufano, Palomba, Bavota, Oliveto, Di Penta, De Lucia & Poshyvanyk (2015) in their study of when code becomes to smell found that \"Code artifacts becoming smelly as consequence of maintenance and evolution activities are characterized by peculiar metrics’ trends.\" A similar conclusion was achieved by the work of Lozano (2009). Palomba, Bavota, Di Penta, Oliveto, De Lucia, & Poshyvanyk (2013) used the change history of source code to detect code smells, similar to the work by Rapu et al (2004). These papers give me both hope and method when building maintainability prediction model by using machine learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moser, Pedrycz & Succi (2008)'s research strongly endorsed using change data of source code to build defect predictors. The change data and process-related metrics contain more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data mining the software code change history has been a hot research topic (Ying et al. 2004) (Zimmermann et al. 2005) (Hassan, 2006, 2008). Palomba has several research works across mining code change history and code smells (Palomba et al. 2015) (Palomba et al. 2013) (Tufano, Palomba et al .2015). However, the above-mentioned research haven't applied machine learning technique on code change history.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's also existing research applying machine learning on change history. Elish, Aljamaan, & Ahmad (2015) compared three empirical studies on predicting software maintainability using ensemble methods. Their work turned out to be extremely useful when I'm doing this research.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inspired by Lohn (2016)'s keynote speak at a Python Conference, I will also try to apply fractal dimension metrics on the code change history. Fractal dimension is a complexity ratio showing how detail in a pattern changes with the scale at which it is measured.(Mandelbrot 1967). One of Lohn (2016)'s example is to apply fractal dimension on the Fixfox crash report. The stack trace in the report can be regarded as a sequence of offsets in the computer memory. By getting the fractal dimension metrics of these sequences, Lohn claimed that sometimes he found seemingly unrated software bugs with similar fractal dimension to have the same cause."

    "\n",
    "**Assumption 1**: We can derive a useful model when applying machine-learning to a large veriety of metrics generated from the source code of a vast number of open source projects. These projects are labeled as abandoned, and well-maintained. This model can be used to predict the probability of becoming abandonware for other software projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumption 2** The prediction model will improve in accuracy when using change history rather than a static view of one version of the software. I assume the change data and process-related metrics contain more information about the defect distribution in software than the source code itself (Moser 2008).\n",

    "The raw data collection, data processing, and data clear=ning part are built using the Ruby programming language. Choosing Ruby is because of the subject being studied is RubyGems.

Because of the heavy load of computing resource needed for the job, I built a simple distributed computing system using Ruby on Rails.\n",

The reason for choosing Python is because it's rich toolboxes of big data and machine learning libraries. I mainly use the Scikit-learn library (Pedregosa, et al 2011) for this job. Another reason for using Python is the Jupyter platform (Kluyver et al. 2016). Jupyter is an interactive platform to create reproducible computational workflows. Jupyter is implemented in Python and has splendid support for using Python in it. Scikit-learn library works perfectly in Jupyter. Jupyter is a nearly perfect EDA platform for me.\n",

    "**Lizard** (Kluth, et al. 2016) is an open source static code analyzer mostly does cyclomatic complexity counting. It supports a large number of different programming languages including Ruby. It also has easy to use interface to extend its analyzing features. As I am the main author and owner of the lizard project, a new requirement can be added to lizard when needed without waiting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**RuboCop** (Batsov, 2012) is a Ruby static code analyzer. It reports a large variety of potentially code problems but mostly focuses on coding styles. It's hard to prevent a static code analyzer focusing on coding styles to be opinionated. RuboCop is so opinionated that it even has a `-a` option to automatically 'correct' some of the problems it discovers. My hope for RuboCop wasn't high when getting it involved. As mentioned above, I just wanted to get as much metrics as possible without judgment. But the result surprised me.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reek** is a code smell detector for Ruby by Rößner (2008). Ruby is a dynamic-typed programming language (Paulson 2007). It is not as easy to get the meaning behind the code by a static analyzer as a static-typed language like Java. A side effect of this research is to evaluate the efficiency of Reek in discovering meaningful code smells."

    "# Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the result of simply statistics and machine learning, we can see that the is some commonality among the well maintained and abandoned open source software at least in the Ruby community. However, the accuracy of the result is not good enough to make an precise prediction. From my research, we can at least draw the following conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Coding style matters, complexity matters\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest finding of this research is not from complicated machine learning or mining the change history. From just averaging and the standard deviation we can see the well-maintained gems has one-fourth less coding style warnings. \"Attractive things work better…\" as explained by Norman (2005) in his Emotional Design, that this is not a myth but because we are all humans. In the end, there might be more emotional reasons that people give up maintaining the open source software they were once passionate about.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cyclomatic complexity reminds a very relevant static code analysis metrics when looking at abandoned and maintained software.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Automatically detected code smells matters, but the results need improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that the overall amount of code smells detected from the abandoned software is statistically higher than the well-maintained ones. However, none of the individual code smells has signification impact on the classification. `TooManyStatements` has greater impact comparing to the others. But it's again rather about style than the code structure. I believe this doesn't make the concept of \"code smells\" less useful, but we can see that automatical code smell detection for dynamic-typing language like Ruby still need a lot of improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Machine learning can be used to predict abandonware, to some degree\n",
    "\n",
    "With more specific criteria (e.g. Spec 4 and 8) to label the `maintained` and `abandoned` gem, we can get better prediction accuracy than generic spec (e.g. Spec 1). Similar to Elish et al. (2015)'s conclusion that ensemble methods perform better than LR and kNN. Also, I found that using change history improved the prediction result, same as Moser et al. (2008) suggested.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitation of this research\n",
    "\n",
    "Well-maintained software probably use some of the static analyzers already. As Beller et al (2016) discovered that 60% of the popular open source project use some sort of static analysis tool. However, lizard is not known to the Ruby community; both Rubocop and Reek has been developed actively in the recent years. Most of the warnings they produce don't exist before the version we examed. The impact on prediction accuracy might be bigger when predicting more recent Ruby software as Rubocop is getting more popular among the Ruby developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The change metrics I have is just by simply get the ago and the delta of each metrics. Perhaps some better metrics e.g. changed lines, test rate and the number of authors can improve it. Also, there must be better sequence labeling technique. Some gems might just need occasional typo fix, update the version of dependencies or other trivial maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, the \"on-line\" information we can find in the code history is only part of the story of an abandoned Ruby gem. The off-line reasons for open source developers to give up their once excited project are not considered here. As the mysteriously disappeared Ruby developer, \"why the lucky stiff\"'s last message on twitter said: \"programming is rather thankless. u see your works become replaced by superior ones in a year. unable to run at all in a few more.\" (why the lucky stiff, 2017)\n"
