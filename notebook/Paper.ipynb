    "Ruby is a popular programming language. It's widely used as a programming language in Web service and automation. Ruby also have large open source community. The RubyGems.org is where most of the open source Ruby project release their software packages. At the beginning of year 2017, there are about 13908 gems, with 1126308 different versions. A lot of software developers are working on their gems all the time.\n",

    "With the rich collection of Ruby gems, people can do their job much faster. But depending on an open source library also introduce future risks. Some software packages do simple and clear things. They tend to stablize after a period of time and do not need much active maintenance. But most non-trivial software libraries do need active maintenance to address new problems, adjust to new environment and adding new features. It can be painful when depending on a third party library and then found that library stopped being maintained.\n",

    "There could be different reasons why certain Ruby project stopped, and why some is still continuing. RubyGems.org keeps all the gems versions and most of the gems developers tend to release often. Perhaps we have find behavioral trace in the releases. Ruby libraries are ditributed in the form of source code. If there's a pattern or we can find a model then we can use it to evaluate Ruby source code or learn how to increase software maintainability.\n",
