    "\n",
    "It takes many years to grow a mature open source community, such as the Ruby community.  The majority of contributions come in the form of specialized software packages developed to solve a specific need, and over time, this collection  evolves into a large third party packages ecosystem.  Many popular open source software projects are continuously developed and maintained.  But there are also once popular software components that get abandoned by the authors, leaving people who depend on them in an unexpected situation. The Source code contains all the efforts that went into making the software.  With a typical open source package management system, we can find the source code of all the packages and associated versions.  In this research, We tried to find a way to apply machine learning to the source code change history.  The primary goal of this study was to develop a model for predicting the risk of abandonware.  The secondary objective was to determine the reasons why some software projects are abandoned while others are well-maintained.  This work is based on data obtained from RubyGems.org -- the principal repository of Ruby packages.  Terabytes of Ruby source code has been explored and analyzed. The result of this research might not be deterministic because the scope of this research is limited to source code. The reasons why some authors gave up their open source projects are not always found in the source code."

    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "As Jack W. Reeves (1992) pointed out, \"the design\" of software is the source code itself. All the efforts in making software eventually embody its value via it's working source code. A programming languages like Ruby are distributed in the form of source code. We can find all the version history of open source software projects from a public package management system. This research tries to find a way of applying machine learning to the source code change history in the Ruby package management system in order to make predictions on software maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "The scope of this research is limited to the RubyGems.org package management system. There are terabytes of source code stored there. We have created criteria for \"abandoned\" and \"well-maintained\" software, and focused the analysis only on packages that fit those criteria. Both the static state of the software project and the change history were analyzed. However, the change history was limited to the versions managed by RubyGems. More complete and detailed change history could be found from the software configuration management system (SCM). However, the SCM was not within the scope of this research.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple statistics and machine learning method were applied to the processed data generated from the source code. I also built a prototype software that does all these works. The purpose of the prototype is to proove the concept. It's not intended to become a commercially useable tool. It's not intended to be generalized to other types of source code prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm trying to ask and find the answers of the following two questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Why are some open source software projects abandoned by their maintainers?\n",
    "2. What makes some open source software projects more maintainable than the others?\n",
    "\n",
    "The exploring of these two questions will be within the scope as mentioned previously.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Some data science method are used here. The massive amount of data from open source package management system will be processed, analyzed and then use machine learning methods to find a model/some models. Eventually, this model will be used to predict the chance of being abandoned and maintainability of current open source projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "A prototype software tool is built to do all the above-mentioned work and prove the concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "The outcome of this research includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* I summarized the discovered difference between abandoned and well-maintained open source projects. The discovery can be useful for people who want to build maintainable software.\n",
    "* I tried to prove the theory of using software package change history to predict software maintainability.\n",
    "* The prototype software tool.\n",
    "* Proccessed and labeled data in the JSON format."

    "Ruby is a popular programming language. It is widely used for development of Web services and infrastructure automation. There is also a large open source ruby community. `RubyGems.org` is the place where most ruby developers release their software packages. Ruby packages are called \"gems\". At the beginning of 2017, there were about 13908 gems with 1126308 different versions. A lot of software developers are working on their gems all the time. In 2016, there were 44 new gems and 332 new versions of existing gems released per day (Ćilimković, 2017).\n",
    "\n",
    "With such rich collection of ruby gems, people can do their job much faster. But depending on an open source library  introduces future risks. Some software packages are focused on simple things. They tend to stabilize after a period of active development and do not need much active maintenance subsequently. But most non-trivial software libraries do need ongoing maintenance to address new features, fix bugs, and adjust to new environments. When the developers of a library stop maintaining it, the users who depend on that library often find it very painful.\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are 1132 Ruby gems stop having any new versions since before 2015, which had been actively maintained for more than ten months before they stopped. We labeled them as \"abandoned\" gems.\n",
    "* There are also many Ruby gems that have been maintained actively for a long time with many releases. From software maintainability's perspective, they are at least \"maintainable\" code some releases back from the recent. We labeled them as \"maintained.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "There could be different reasons why certain Ruby project stopped, and why some are still continuing. RubyGems.org keeps all the gems versions and most of the gems developers tend to release often. Perhaps we can find a behavioral trace in the releases. Ruby libraries are distributed in the form of source code. If there's a pattern or we can get a model, then we can use it to evaluate Ruby source code or learn how to increase software maintainability."

    "### On maintainability\n",
    "\n",
    "Software maintainability is an important factor in the cost of owning a codebase. IEEE defines it as “the ease with which a software system or component can be modified to correct faults, improve the performance or other attributes, or adapt to a changed environment” (IEEE, 1990). Here we will try to define maintainable software from the result of the development activity's perspective. Let's consider a software component in a maintained state at a certain point of time *T*.  If this component continues to be actively maintained to correct faults, improve the performance or other attributes, for a subsequent period *P*, then we can say the state of the software at the time *T* has at least some maintainability. We can also make an assumption that if a software system is not maintained at *T*, it tends to have less maintainability in the future. Especially, it is so when there's evidence based on the software development history before *T* that continuous maintenance is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the above assumption, we can label a version of software as \"maintainable\" or \"not maintainable\" by analyzing its release history."

    "### On open source \"Abandonware\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Khong (2007) defined abandonware as the copyrighted work that's still owned by the owner, but because the owner ignored the work it is no longer commercially available to the public. One problem caused by abandonware, as pointed out by Khong (2007) is that some software may need continual support from the vendors or producers. Many open source software also fit in the definition of abandonware, that is the source code is still available to the public, but the owner of the project ignores it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Khong (2007) mentioned, \"A related problem of abandonment of computer software is the unavailability\n",
    "of source codes to correct or modify a computer program.\" It is no longer the case for open source abandonware. However having the source of origin doesn't solve the problem completely. It still takes the domain knowledge, the knowledge of the software structure, the interest and the effort to maintain the software, which the user of open source software might not have. And the original access point (the library server, the version control system) might still be owned by the original author. Then it's hard to continue the project and share the maintained work with the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my research of the Ruby open source abandonware, I found some have over a hundred open issues on Github. Some people depending on the software are crying for support. Some of the abandonware have tens of pull requests, but the owners just ignore them. One example is the CanCan Ruby gem created by Ryan Bates and first released in 2009 and soon becomes very popular (6000+ stars on Github as of today). It's an enhancement to the Ruby on Rails framework to support authorization. As it's intended to be part of the framework, projects depending on CanCan tend to have a tight coupling with it. When in 2013 the project suddenly stopped all development activity on Github, it became a big problem. We can see now the CanCan project has more than eight hundred forks. Some people chose to take the source code and maintain it by themselves. Eventually, some people formed the \"CanCanCan Community\" and continue the \"CanCan\" project under the name of \"CanCanCan\" (https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan).\n",
    "\n",
    "Abandonware doesn't always indicate unmaintainable software. For example, \"why the lucky stiff\" (2017) is the nickname of a Ruby programmer who was considered one of the best Ruby programmers in the world (Spolsky 2005). He mythically disappeared since 2009. It's probably not right to call his legacy \"unmaintainable.\""

    "## Literature Review\n",
    "\n",
    "Riaz, Mendes,& Tempero (2009) had a systematic review of software maintainability prediction and metrics. They found that the commonly used maintainability prediction models were based on algorithmic techniques. And the method could be particular with some maintenance type. Size, complexity and coupling, all these are collected at source code level only. There's a lack of accuracy measures and cross-validation. They also found that expert judgment plays an important role when designing these metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Riaz et al. (2009) suggested the creation of more robust and reliable software maintainability prediction models. It is what I'm trying to achieve by this research. In my prediction model, although the underlying data is also mostly from source code, I put them in time scale and combined several tools' result to avoid prejudice. I intended to use machine learning mechanism to prevent expert opinion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beller, Bholanath, McIntosh, & Zaidman (2016) made a research on the usage of Automated Static Analysis Tools (ASATs). In their study, they found that 60% of the most popular open source projects use ASATs, although not embed them as part of their workflow. It might bias my data a bit, as some of the popular projects used ASAT, therefore the analyzing result has been optimized towards certain tool already. But I'm confident that it won't have a big impact. Because in my research, I only take code older than 2015. All the three tools I used has tons of new features since 2015.\n",
    "\n",
    "My open source Static Analyzer \"lizard\" has been used in many large projects, including the ATLAS project at CERN (Kluth, et al. 2016). The ATLAS Experiment (Anelli et al. 2008) use lizard to get the cyclomatic complexity metrics in their C++ and Python code. Lizard also supports many other programming languages including Ruby.\n",
    "\n",
    "I use the countings of automatically detected \"code smells\" as part of the data I extract from source code. Code smells, as Fowler & Beck (1999) defined as symptoms of poor design and implementation choices. They are the anti-patterns. As a result, code smells will affect the maintainability of software. Tufano, Palomba, Bavota, Oliveto, Di Penta, De Lucia & Poshyvanyk (2015) in their study of when code becomes to smell found that \"Code artifacts becoming smelly as consequence of maintenance and evolution activities are characterized by peculiar metrics’ trends.\" A similar conclusion was achieved by the work of Lozano (2009). Palomba, Bavota, Di Penta, Oliveto, De Lucia, & Poshyvanyk (2013) used the change history of source code to detect code smells, similar to the work by Rapu et al (2004). These papers give me both hope and method when building maintainability prediction model by using machine learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moser, Pedrycz & Succi (2008)'s research strongly endorsed using change data of source code to build defect predictors. The change data and process-related metrics contain more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data mining the software code change history has been a hot research topic (Ying et al. 2004) (Zimmermann et al. 2005) (Hassan, 2006, 2008). Palomba has several researches works across mining code change history and code smells (Palomba et al. 2015) (Palomba et al. 2013) (Tufano, Palomba et al .2015). However, the above-mentioned researches haven't applied machine learning technique on code change history.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's also existing research applying machine learning on change history. Elish, Aljamaan, & Ahmad (2015) compared three empirical studies on predicting software maintainability using ensemble methods. Their work turned out to be extremely useful when I'm doing this research.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inspired by Lohn (2016)'s keynote speak at a Python Conference, I will also try to apply fractal dimension metrics on the code change history. Fractal dimension is a complexity ratio showing how detail in a pattern changes with the scale at which it is measured.(Mandelbrot 1967). One of Lohn (2016)'s example is to apply fractal dimension on the Fixfox crash report. The stack trace in the report can be regarded as a sequence of offsets in the computer memory. By getting the fractal dimension metrics of these sequences, Lohn claimed that sometimes he found seemingly unrated software bugs with similar fractal dimension to have the same cause."

    "**Assumption 1**: We can derive a useful model when applying machine-learning to a large variety of metrics generated from the source code of a vast number of open source projects. These projects are labeled as abandoned, and well-maintained. This model can be used to predict the probability of becoming abandonware for other software projects.\n",

It's hard to prevent a static code analyzer focusing on coding styles to be opinionated. RuboCop is so opinionated that it even has a `-a` option to automatically 'correct' some of the problems it discovers. My hope for RuboCop wasn't high when getting it involved. As mentioned above, I just wanted to get as much metrics as possible without judgment. But the result surprised me.\n",

    "# Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the result of simply statistics and machine learning, we can see that the is some commonality among the well maintained and abandoned open source software at least in the Ruby community. However, the accuracy of the result is not good enough to make a precise prediction. From my research, we can at least draw the following conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Coding style matters, complexity matters\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest finding of this research is not from complicated machine learning or mining the change history. From just averaging and the standard deviation we can see the well-maintained gems has one-fourth less coding style warnings. \"Attractive things work better…\" as explained by Norman (2005) in his Emotional Design, that this is not a myth but because we are all humans. In the end, there might be more emotional reasons that people give up maintaining the open source software they were once passionate about.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cyclomatic complexity reminds a very relevant static code analysis metrics when looking at abandoned and maintained software.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Automatically detected code smells matters, but the results need improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that the overall amount of code smells detected from the abandoned software is statistically higher than the well-maintained ones. However, none of the individual code smells has signification impact on the classification. `TooManyStatements` has greater impact comparing to the others. But it's again rather about style than the code structure. I believe this doesn't make the concept of \"code smells\" less useful, but we can see that automatical code smell detection for dynamic-typing language like Ruby still need a lot of improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Machine learning can be used to predict abandonware, to some degree\n",
    "\n",
    "With more specific criteria (e.g. Spec 4 and 8) to label the `maintained` and `abandoned` gem, we can get better prediction accuracy than generic spec (e.g. Spec 1). Similar to Elish et al. (2015)'s conclusion that ensemble methods perform better than LR and kNN. Also, I found that using change history improved the prediction result, same as Moser et al. (2008) suggested.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitation of this research\n",
    "\n",
    "The well-maintained software projects probably use some of the static analyzers already. As Beller et al (2016) discovered that 60% of the popular open source project use some sort of static analysis tool. However, lizard is not known to the Ruby community; both Rubocop and Reek has been developed actively in the recent years. Most of the warnings they produce don't exist before the version we examed. The impact on prediction accuracy might be bigger when predicting more recent Ruby software as Rubocop is getting more popular among the Ruby developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The change metrics I have is just by simply get the ago and the delta of each metrics. Perhaps some better metrics e.g. changed lines, test rate and the number of authors can improve it. Also, there must be better sequence labeling technique. Some gems might just need occasional typo fix, update the version of dependencies or other trivial maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, the \"on-line\" information we can find in the code history is only part of the story of an abandoned Ruby gem. The off-line reasons for open source developers to give up their once excited project are not considered here. As the mysteriously disappeared Ruby developer, \"why the lucky stiff\"'s last message on twitter said: \"programming is rather thankless. u see your works become replaced by superior ones in a year. unable to run at all in a few more.\" (why the lucky stiff, 2017)\n"
